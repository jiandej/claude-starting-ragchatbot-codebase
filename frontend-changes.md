## Overview

This document covers three major enhancements to the development infrastructure and user interface:
1. **Code Quality Tools Implementation**: Essential development tools for consistent, high-quality code
2. **Testing Framework Enhancement**: Comprehensive API testing infrastructure
3. **Theme Toggle Feature**: Dark/light theme switching functionality

---

## Part 1: Code Quality Tools Implementation

### Overview
Added essential code quality tools to the development workflow to ensure consistent, high-quality code throughout the codebase.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Code Formatting Tools Added
- **Black** for automatic code formatting with 88-character line length
- **isort** for consistent import organization with trailing commas
- **flake8** for comprehensive code linting and style checks

#### 2. Development Scripts Created
- `scripts/format.sh`: Format all Python code with Black and isort
- `scripts/lint.sh`: Run flake8 linting with proper configuration
- `scripts/test.sh`: Execute pytest with proper configuration
- `scripts/quality-check.sh`: Run complete quality pipeline (format + lint + test)

#### 3. Configuration Files Added
- `.flake8`: Comprehensive linting configuration with Black compatibility
- `pyproject.toml`: Black and isort configuration with proper settings
- Updated dependencies to include quality tools

#### 4. Enhanced CLAUDE.md
- Added "Code Quality Tools" section with script usage instructions
- Updated development workflow to include quality checks
- Added standards documentation for team consistency

### Quality Standards Enforced

- **Black formatting**: 88-character lines, consistent style
- **Import organization**: Sorted, grouped imports with trailing commas
- **Code linting**: PEP 8 compliance with Black compatibility
- **Test coverage**: All code should have corresponding tests

## Part 2: Testing Framework Enhancement

### Summary

Enhanced the existing testing framework for the RAG system in `backend/tests` with comprehensive API testing infrastructure. This was primarily a backend testing enhancement, but it provides critical infrastructure for testing the API endpoints that the frontend depends on.

### Changes Made

#### 1. pytest Configuration (`pyproject.toml`)
- Added `pytest.ini_options` configuration section
- Configured test discovery patterns and paths
- Added test markers for different test categories:
  - `unit`: Unit tests for individual components
  - `integration`: Integration tests for component interactions  
  - `api`: API endpoint tests
  - `slow`: Tests that take longer to run
- Added required dependencies: `httpx>=0.24.0`, `pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0`
- Configured asyncio mode for async test support

#### 2. Enhanced Test Fixtures (`backend/tests/conftest.py`)
- Added `mock_rag_system`: Mock RAGSystem for API testing
- Added `test_app`: FastAPI test application with inline endpoint definitions
- Added `client`: TestClient fixture for making API requests
- Enhanced imports to support FastAPI testing components

#### 3. Comprehensive API Endpoint Tests (`backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py`)
- **17 comprehensive test cases** covering all API endpoints:
  - `/api/query` - Query processing with various scenarios
  - `/api/courses` - Course statistics endpoint
  - `/api/session/{session_id}/clear` - Session management
  - `/` - Root endpoint
- **Test Coverage Includes:**
  - Basic functionality testing
  - Request/response validation
  - Error handling (invalid JSON, wrong content types, missing parameters)
  - HTTP method validation
  - Session management workflows
  - Source formatting validation
  - CORS configuration testing
  - Integration workflow testing

#### 4. Key Testing Features
- **Isolated Test Environment**: Test app avoids static file mounting issues
- **Mocked Dependencies**: All external dependencies properly mocked
- **Async Test Support**: Full support for async endpoint testing
- **Comprehensive Error Testing**: Tests invalid inputs, wrong methods, missing data
- **Integration Workflows**: Tests realistic user interaction patterns

## Part 3: Theme Toggle Feature

### Overview
Added a dark/light theme toggle button that allows users to switch between themes with smooth animations and accessibility support.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `index.html`
- **Added theme toggle button** positioned in the top-right corner
- Includes sun and moon SVG icons for visual theme indication
- Button has proper `aria-label` for accessibility
- Icons are positioned absolutely within the button for smooth transitions

#### 2. `style.css`
- **Added light theme CSS variables** with appropriate color scheme:
  - Light backgrounds (`#ffffff`, `#f8fafc`)
  - Dark text colors for contrast (`#1e293b`, `#64748b`)
  - Adjusted shadows and borders for light theme
  - Maintained primary blue colors for consistency

- **Added theme toggle button styles**:
  - Fixed positioning in top-right corner
  - Circular design (48px diameter)
  - Hover effects with transform and shadow changes
  - Focus states for keyboard accessibility
  - Responsive sizing for mobile (44px on small screens)

- **Added smooth icon transitions**:
  - Icons rotate and scale during theme changes
  - Sun icon visible in light theme, moon in dark theme
  - 0.3s transition duration for smooth animation

- **Added universal transitions**:
  - All elements transition background, color, border, and shadow properties
  - 0.3s ease timing for consistent feel across the interface

#### 3. `script.js`
- **Added theme toggle DOM element** to global variables
- **Added theme functionality**:
  - `initializeTheme()`: Loads saved theme from localStorage or defaults to dark
  - `toggleTheme()`: Switches between dark and light themes
  - `setTheme()`: Applies theme and updates accessibility attributes
  - Theme preference persisted in localStorage

- **Added event listeners**:
  - Click handler for theme toggle button
  - Keyboard accessibility (Enter and Space keys)
  - Updates aria-label based on current theme

### Features Implemented

#### ✅ Design & Positioning
- Toggle button positioned in top-right corner
- Sun/moon icon design with smooth animations
- Fits existing design aesthetic with proper shadows and borders

#### ✅ Light Theme Colors
- High contrast light backgrounds and dark text
- Proper border and surface colors for light mode
- Maintains accessibility standards
- Preserves visual hierarchy and design language

#### ✅ JavaScript Functionality
- Smooth theme switching on button click
- Theme preference persistence via localStorage
- Proper initialization on page load

#### ✅ Accessibility & UX
- Keyboard navigation support (Enter/Space keys)
- Dynamic aria-label updates
- Smooth 0.3s transitions between themes
- Visual feedback with hover/focus states
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Impact on Development

### Code Quality Benefits
1. **Consistency**: All code follows the same formatting and style standards
2. **Readability**: Uniform code style improves code comprehension
3. **Quality**: Automated linting catches potential issues early
4. **Productivity**: Automated formatting saves developer time
5. **Maintainability**: Consistent codebase is easier to maintain

### Testing Framework Benefits
1. **API Contract Validation**: Ensures frontend can rely on consistent API behavior
2. **Error Scenario Testing**: Validates how API handles invalid requests frontend might send
3. **Session Management Testing**: Confirms session workflows work correctly
4. **Response Format Validation**: Ensures frontend receives expected data structures

### User Experience Benefits
1. **Theme Flexibility**: Users can choose their preferred visual theme
2. **Accessibility**: Proper keyboard navigation and screen reader support
3. **Performance**: Smooth transitions enhance perceived performance
4. **Personalization**: Theme preference persistence across sessions

The API tests serve as a contract validation layer between frontend and backend, providing confidence that API endpoints behave as expected when the frontend makes requests.
