# Frontend Changes - Code Quality Tools Implementation

## Overview
Added essential code quality tools to the development workflow to ensure consistent, high-quality code throughout the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Formatting Tools Added

#### Black - Automatic Code Formatting
- Added `black>=24.0.0` to project dependencies
- Configured with 88-character line length in `pyproject.toml`
- Applied Black formatting to all Python files in the codebase
- Excludes common build/cache directories (.git, __pycache__, etc.)

#### isort - Import Organization
- Added `isort>=5.12.0` to project dependencies
- Configured to work with Black (compatible profiles)
- Applied consistent import sorting across all Python files
- Multi-line output with trailing commas for better diffs

### 2. Code Quality Checking

#### flake8 - Code Linting
- Added `flake8>=7.0.0` to project dependencies
- Configured with Black-compatible settings
- Max line length: 88 characters
- Ignores E203 (whitespace before ':') and W503 (line break before binary operator) for Black compatibility
- Created both `.flake8` config file and `pyproject.toml` configuration

### 3. Development Scripts

Created executable shell scripts in `scripts/` directory:

#### `scripts/format.sh`
- Runs Black code formatter
- Runs isort import organizer
- Automatically fixes formatting issues

#### `scripts/lint.sh`
- Runs flake8 linting with statistics
- Runs Black in check-only mode
- Runs isort in check-only mode
- Reports issues without making changes

#### `scripts/test.sh`
- Runs pytest with verbose output and short traceback
- Executes from backend directory

#### `scripts/quality-check.sh`
- Comprehensive quality check script
- Runs formatting, linting, and tests in sequence
- Ensures all quality standards are met

### 4. Configuration Files

#### `pyproject.toml` Updates
- Added code quality tool dependencies
- Configured Black with 88-character line length and Python 3.13 target
- Configured isort with Black-compatible profile
- Added flake8 configuration section

#### `.flake8` Configuration
- Standalone flake8 configuration file
- 88-character line length
- Excludes build/cache directories
- Ignores Black-incompatible rules

### 5. Documentation Updates

#### `CLAUDE.md` Enhancements
- Added "Code Quality Tools" section with script usage examples
- Added "Code Quality Standards" section documenting the tools and expectations
- Clear instructions for developers on running quality checks

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All code now follows the same formatting standards
2. **Quality**: Automated linting catches potential issues early
3. **Developer Experience**: Simple scripts make it easy to maintain code quality
4. **CI/CD Ready**: Scripts can be integrated into automated workflows
5. **Team Collaboration**: Reduces formatting-related merge conflicts

## Usage

```bash
# Format code automatically
./scripts/format.sh

# Check code quality
./scripts/lint.sh

# Run tests
./scripts/test.sh

# Complete quality check
./scripts/quality-check.sh
```

## Files Modified

### New Files Created
- `scripts/format.sh` - Code formatting script
- `scripts/lint.sh` - Code quality checking script  
- `scripts/test.sh` - Test execution script
- `scripts/quality-check.sh` - Complete quality check script
- `.flake8` - Flake8 configuration file
- `frontend-changes.md` - This documentation file

### Existing Files Modified
- `pyproject.toml` - Added quality tool dependencies and configuration
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added code quality documentation
- All Python files in `backend/` and `main.py` - Applied Black formatting and isort import organization

## Next Steps

1. Integrate quality checks into CI/CD pipeline
2. Add pre-commit hooks to run quality checks automatically
3. Consider adding type checking with mypy
4. Add code coverage reporting with pytest-cov

## Quality Standards Enforced

- **Black formatting**: 88-character lines, consistent style
- **Import organization**: Sorted, grouped imports with trailing commas
- **Code linting**: PEP 8 compliance with Black compatibility
- **Test coverage**: All code should have corresponding tests
